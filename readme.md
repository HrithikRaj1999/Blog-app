# Project Setup Instructions

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:

- `client`: Contains the front-end application, built with React.
- `server`: Contains the back-end server, probably built with Node.js.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

## Installation

To install dependencies for both the client and server, run this command from the root directory:

```bash
npm install
```

## To start both the client and server concurrently, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
